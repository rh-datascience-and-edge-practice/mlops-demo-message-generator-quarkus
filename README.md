# mlops-demo-message-generator Project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Starting a local instance of Kafka using Docker or Podman

If required, a local instance of a Kafka server can be run using either Docker or Podman:

```shell script
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

> **_NOTE:_**  This docker-compose file was abstracted from: https://developer.confluent.io/quickstart/kafka-docker/. Another alternative to consider is the one found at: https://redhat-developer-demos.github.io/quarkus-tutorial/quarkus-tutorial/kafka-and-streams.html

Once started, there is a Kafdrop UI container that can be accessed using http://localhost:9000

Another alternative is to use a Visual Studio Code Extension such as [Tools for Apache Kafka](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeppeandersen.vscode-kafka) to view the Kafka topic during development phase.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/mlops-demo-message-generator-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
